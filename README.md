# thriftstore

Using SQLite3 and Tkinter we implemented a CRUD application for a thrift store database

## Running Application for First Time
 
 When you first run the application, you should not have lines 35-38 commented out in the db.py file
 After running it once, however, you should comment it out so nothing is inserted twice.
